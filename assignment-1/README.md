### 1.2 Alien
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the 
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the 
toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)
1)	Pick up the toothbrush by its handle with whichever hand you prefer (if not humanoid, choose a tentacle or whatever).
2)	Pick up the toothpaste tube in the other hand (or tentacle) and twist its cap off anti-clockwise.
3)	Aim the head of the toothpaste tube to the head of the toothbrush.
4)	Squeeze the tube so that the toothpaste comes out.
5)	The toothpaste must be placed on the head of the toothbrush where the “hair” is.
6)	When done, put the cap back on the toothpaste tube.
7)	Direct the toothbrush up to your mouth.
8)	Slowly in a circular motion brush your teeth. This should be done with the hairs on the brush against your teeth.
9)	Work your way from one side to another.
10)	Open your mouth and brush the inside of your teeth.
11)	Continue until all your teeth have been brushed.
12)	When done, spit out the accumulated foamed paste.
13)	Wash your mouth with water.
14)	Clean your toothbrush with water.
15)	Done.

## 3 Give your thoughts on TDD
- What was positive and good about using TDD?
  It made a me think a bit more on the solution to pass the test. It also helped by setting a clear goal as to when the solution was correct.
- What was annoying or difficult?
  It was a bit annoying when I first ran the tests but not all methods was implemented. However, xunit test do have an easy way to skip those tests, which was quite nice to use in this case.
- What surprised you?
  How easy it was to create nested tests.
- Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?
  Probably not in this case. For more complex testing I think it will.
